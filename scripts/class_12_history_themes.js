preoccupied with comparing and contrasting what he saw in india with situation in europe&gt;france.</li><li>described situation in india &gt; depressed</li><li>his travled in mughal empire &gt; critical insights &gt; compared europe with mughals &gt; establishing superiroty of former &gt; india represented as inverse of europe</li></ol><div><br></div><div><b>6.1 The question of landownership ?</b></div><ol><li>&nbsp;According to bernier &gt; fundamental difference between mughals and europe &gt; ownership of private land</li><li>Lack of private property by people in mughal india</li><li>bernier &gt; firm beliver in virtue of private property and saw crown ownership of land being harmful for both state and its subjects</li><li>this view not unique to bernier and found in accounts of other travellers also</li><li>defect in system of no private land &gt; no hereditary claim &gt; no growth &gt; absence of private property &gt; prevented emergence of class of so called improving landlords as it was the case in europe</li><li>bernier pointed out &gt; this led to ruination of agriculture &gt; excessive oppression of peasantry &gt; decline in standards of all sections of society except ruling aristocracy.</li><li>being very critical of society &gt; he described indian society as consisting of undifferentiated masses of impoversihed people &gt; subjugated by small minority of rich and powerful ruling class</li><li>Bernier asserted &gt; <b>There is no middle state in india</b> &gt; reason &gt; either people were poorest of poor or richest of rich.&nbsp;</li><li>this is how bernier saw mughal empire &gt; king of beggars and barbarian &gt; ill air of cities &gt; fields overspread with bushes&nbsp;</li><li>and all these things because of just one thing &gt; crown ownership of land &gt; perhaps too much emphasis on just one thing</li><li>Curiously &gt; none of mughal official documents suggest state was sole owner of land &gt; for instance &gt; Abul Fazl in 16th century &gt; official chronicler of Akbar's reign &gt; describes land revenue as remunerations of sovereignty , a claim made by ruler on his subjects for the protection he provided rather than as a rent &gt; like paying salary to a guard for protecting people &gt; this thought can be traced back to ancient history too &gt; where people decided to give extra food and other things to the king or ruler who will protect the people of tribes &gt; this is how office king came into existence</li><li>&nbsp;may be european Travellers did not understand such system of land revenue &gt; land revenue was also high</li><li>however this was not a rent or land tax &gt; it was tax on crop produce</li><li>bernier accounts shaped thoughts of others also &gt; Montesquie, French &gt; used bernier's idea to develope idea of oriental despotism(means dictatorship, tyranny) &gt; rulers enjoyed absolute authority and subjects barely survived due to non-existence of private land</li><li>&nbsp;Fast forwarding to 19th century &gt; karl marx &gt; developed this idea &gt; a stagnant system &gt; where before colonial rule surplus appropriated by state &gt; led to development of autonomous villages &gt; and respecting their autonomy as long as surplus was unimpeded.</li><li><span>But above picture far from being true &gt; rural society had condiderable social and economic differentiation &gt; at one end big zamindars who enjoyed superior rights over land and on the other side &gt; untouchables landless labourers</span></li></ol><div><br></div><div>6.2 A more complex social reality<ol><li>bernier's preoccupied with thought of mughal state as tyrannical is obvious &gt; but social reality more complex &gt; artisans no incentive to improve since profits appropriated by state</li><li>manufactures in decline</li><li>high import of precious metals into india &gt; as manufactures exported in exchange for gold and silver</li><li>merchant community prospered &gt; engaged in long distance trade</li><li>17th century &gt; 15% population lived in towns &gt; higher than that of europe at this time</li><li>bernier mentioned about &gt; Camp towns &gt; means temporary town built around imerial camp &gt; when imerial camp moved &gt; camp towns declined &gt; camp towns no social and economi foundation but dependent on imperial patronage for their survival</li><li>now coming to the question of LANDOWNERSHIP &gt; there were all types of towns &gt; manufacturing town, trading , ports, sacred centres, pilgrimage towns &gt; their existence was index of prosperity of merchant communities</li><li>merchants &gt; often strong community or kin ties &gt; in western india called <b>Mahajans</b> &gt; their chief called <b>Sheth</b> &gt; in Ahmedabad mahajans collective chief&nbsp; called &gt; <b>Nagarseth</b> .&nbsp;</li><li>Other groups &gt; physicians &gt; hakim &gt; teachers &gt; pundits or mullas &gt; lawyers &gt; wakil &gt; shops in bazars , dancers, musicians etc</li><li>some dependent on imerial patronage and other made living by serving other patrons&nbsp;</li><li>hence it can be conluded that bernier in the matter of LANDOWNERSHIP provided a oversimplified picture .</li></ol><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Source 11: The poor peasant<div><ol><li>bernier's description&nbsp;
