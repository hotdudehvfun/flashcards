preoccupied with comparing and contrasting what he saw in india with situation in europe&gt;france.</li><li>described situation in india &gt; depressed</li><li>his travled in mughal empire &gt; critical insights &gt; compared europe with mughals &gt; establishing superiroty of former &gt; india represented as inverse of europe</li></ol><div><br></div><div><b>6.1 The question of landownership ?</b></div><ol><li>&nbsp;According to bernier &gt; fundamental difference between mughals and europe &gt; ownership of private land</li><li>Lack of private property by people in mughal india</li><li>bernier &gt; firm beliver in virtue of private property and saw crown ownership of land being harmful for both state and its subjects</li><li>this view not unique to bernier and found in accounts of other travellers also</li><li>defect in system of no private land &gt; no hereditary claim &gt; no growth &gt; absence of private property &gt; prevented emergence of class of so called improving landlords as it was the case in europe</li><li>bernier pointed out &gt; this led to ruination of agriculture &gt; excessive oppression of peasantry &gt; decline in standards of all sections of society except ruling aristocracy.</li><li>being very critical of society &gt; he described indian society as consisting of undifferentiated masses of impoversihed people &gt; subjugated by small minority of rich and powerful ruling class</li><li>Bernier asserted &gt; <b>There is no middle state in india</b> &gt; reason &gt; either people were poorest of poor or richest of rich.&nbsp;</li><li>this is how bernier saw mughal empire &gt; king of beggars and barbarian &gt; ill air of cities &gt; fields overspread with bushes&nbsp;</li><li>and all these things because of just one thing &gt; crown ownership of land &gt; perhaps too much emphasis on just one thing</li><li>Curiously &gt; none of mughal official documents suggest state was sole owner of land &gt; for instance &gt; Abul Fazl in 16th century &gt; official chronicler of Akbar's reign &gt; describes land revenue as remunerations of sovereignty , a claim made by ruler on his subjects for the protection he provided rather than as a rent &gt; like paying salary to a guard for protecting people &gt; this thought can be traced back to ancient history too &gt; where people decided to give extra food and other things to the king or ruler who will protect the people of tribes &gt; this is how office king came into existence</li><li>&nbsp;may be european Travellers did not understand such system of land revenue &gt; land revenue was also high</li><li>however this was not a rent or land tax &gt; it was tax on crop produce</li><li>bernier accounts shaped thoughts of others also &gt; Montesquie, French &gt; used bernier's idea to develope idea of oriental despotism(means dictatorship, tyranny) &gt; rulers enjoyed absolute authority and subjects barely survived due to non-existence of private land</li><li>&nbsp;Fast forwarding to 19th century &gt; karl marx &gt; developed this idea &gt; a stagnant system &gt; where before colonial rule surplus appropriated by state &gt; led to development of autonomous villages &gt; and respecting their autonomy as long as surplus was unimpeded.</li><li><span>But above picture far from being true &gt; rural society had condiderable social and economic differentiation &gt; at one end big zamindars who enjoyed superior rights over land and on the other side &gt; untouchables landless labourers</span></li></ol><div><br></div><div>6.2 A more complex social reality<ol><li>bernier's preoccupied with thought of mughal state as tyrannical is obvious &gt; but social reality more complex &gt; artisans no incentive to improve since profits appropriated by state</li><li>manufactures in decline</li><li>high import of precious metals into india &gt; as manufactures exported in exchange for gold and silver</li><li>merchant community prospered &gt; engaged in long distance trade</li><li>17th century &gt; 15% population lived in towns &gt; higher than that of europe at this time</li><li>bernier mentioned about &gt; Camp towns &gt; means temporary town built around imerial camp &gt; when imerial camp moved &gt; camp towns declined &gt; camp towns no social and economi foundation but dependent on imperial patronage for their survival</li><li>now coming to the question of LANDOWNERSHIP &gt; there were all types of towns &gt; manufacturing town, trading , ports, sacred centres, pilgrimage towns &gt; their existence was index of prosperity of merchant communities</li><li>merchants &gt; often strong community or kin ties &gt; in western india called <b>Mahajans</b> &gt; their chief called <b>Sheth</b> &gt; in Ahmedabad mahajans collective chief&nbsp; called &gt; <b>Nagarseth</b> .&nbsp;</li><li>Other groups &gt; physicians &gt; hakim &gt; teachers &gt; pundits or mullas &gt; lawyers &gt; wakil &gt; shops in bazars , dancers, musicians etc</li><li>some dependent on imerial patronage and other made living by serving other patrons&nbsp;</li><li>hence it can be conluded that bernier in the matter of LANDOWNERSHIP provided a oversimplified picture .</li></ol><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Source 11: The poor peasant<div><ol><li>bernier's description&nbsp;

The Village Community</b><ol class="custom-list"><li>From point 1 &gt; it clear that agricultural production involved intensive participation of peasantary</li><li>Now will discuss social groups involved in agricultural expansion</li><li>It is clear that peasants held lands as individuals &gt; and &gt; also evidences of collective land holdings belonged to village community</li><li>Cummnity had <b>3 members</b> &gt; <b>cultivators</b> &gt; <b>panchayat</b> &gt; village headman known as <b>Muqaddam</b> or mandal</li></ol><div><br></div><div><b>2.1 Caste and the Rural Milieu</b><ol><li>Deep inequities on basis of caste &gt; other caste-like distinctions &gt; cultivators were highly heterogeneous groups</li><li>Workers as menials or agricultural labourers called Majur</li><li>Despite abundance of cultivable land &gt; certain caste groups were assigned menial task s&gt; they remain poor</li><li>No provision of censur during these times &gt; can't say about how many people were engaged in menial tasks</li><li>Distinctions in community &gt; Muslims community &gt; menial labourers were called <b>Halakhoran (scavengers)</b> &gt; lived outside the boundaries of village</li><li>In Bihar &gt; <b>Mallahzadas (son of boatmen)</b> &gt; comparable to slaves</li><li>Direct correlation can be established between caste, poverty and social status &gt; lower caste as menial labour &gt; remained poor and at bttom of social hierarchy</li><li>But such correlation not rigid at intermediate levels &gt; example &gt; Marwar, Rajputs peasants sharing same status with Jats</li><li>Gauravas of Vrindavan (UP) &gt; who cultivated lands &gt; sought rajout status later</li><li><b>Ahirs </b>&gt; <b>Gujars </b>&gt; <b>Malis </b>&gt; rose in hierarchy because of profitability of cattle rearing and horticulture &gt; power of pelf can nullify effects of caste</li><li>Eastern regions &gt; pastorals and fishing castes like Sadgops and Kaivartas acquired status of peasants</li></ol><div><br></div></div></div><div><br></div><div><b>2.2 PANCHAYATs and headmen</b><ol><li>Village PANCHAYATS &gt; <b>assembly of elders</b> &gt; mostly big guns &gt; enjoyed hereditary rights over property</li><li>village &gt; mixed-castes &gt; PANCHAYAT was heterogeneous body &gt; representing various castes &gt; but menial-cum-agricultural workers unlikely to be represented in body</li><li>PANCHAYAT decision binding on members</li><li>Headman called &gt; <b>muqaddam </b>or <b>mandal </b>&gt; some sources suggest headman was choosen through consensus of village elders &gt; but choice had to be <b>ratified by Zamindar</b> &gt; headman held office as long as he enjoyed confidence of village elders &gt; mean no fix tenure</li><li>Headman functions &gt; supervise accounts &gt; assisted by village accountant known as <b>patwari</b> .</li><li>panchayat financial sources &gt; funds made by individuals to a common pool &gt; these funds were used for defraying costs of entertainin revenue officials who visted village from time to time</li><li>funds also used for welfare and during natural calamities &gt; construction of canals</li><li>Most important function of panchayat &gt; ensure rigid caste boundaries among various communities</li><li>Eastern india &gt; mandal (headmen) ensured &gt; marriages in presence of the mandal</li><li>Headmen to oversee conduct of members &gt; prevent offence against caste</li><li>panchayat &gt; can inflict serious forms of punishments like fines and expulsion from community in rare cases &gt; person forced to leave village became an outcaste and lost right to practise profession</li><li>In addition to PANCHAYATS &gt; each caste or jati in village &gt; had own Jati panchayat like intra-caste panchayat</li><li>In most cases except criminal cases &gt; state respected decisions of jati panchayats</li><li>Archival records form western india &gt; <b>petitions were allowed</b> &gt; compaining about extortionate taxation or unpaid labour imposed by superior castes</li><li>collective petitions &gt; by lower caste group against elites &gt; can be about excessive tax demands &gt; they regarded village panchayats as court of appeal that whould ensure that state carried out its moral obligations</li><li>Conflict between lower-caste and elites &gt; if compromsie failed &gt; peasants had a effective weapon&nbsp; &gt; to desert the village and settle somewhere else &gt; this technique worked as there was abundance of uncultivated land</li></ol><div><br></div></div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>2.3 Village Artisans</b><ol><li>Artisans and peasants &gt; distinction was fluid &gt; both groups performed tasks of both</li><li>cultivators &gt; also took to craft production &gt; such as &gt; dyeing, textile printing, baking, firing of pottery, making and repairing agricultural implements</li><li>period between sowing and harvesting &gt; peasants engaged in craft production to earn extra</li><li>Artisans such as &gt; potters, blacksmiths, carpenters, barbers, even goldsmiths &gt; in return of their service &gt; they will get share of harvest, land or cultivable wastes&nbsp;</li><li>In Maharashtra &gt; such lands (given to artisans in lieu of payment) &gt; called as <b>Miras</b> or <b>watan</b> &gt; hereditary holdings</li><li>&nbsp;Another variant of system between artisans and peasants &gt; mutually negotiated system of remuneration&nbsp; &gt; example &gt; Zamindars in bengal, renumerated blacksmiths, carpenters, etc for their work by paying them a small daily allowance and diet money &gt; this system called &gt; <b>Jajmani system</b> .</li><li>such evidences indicates intricate ways in which exchange networks operated at micro-level of village</li><li>this&nbsp; does not mean there was not cash renumeration&nbsp;</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>2.4 A little republic ?</b><ol><li>British officials saw villages as &gt; little republic made up of fraternal partners sharing resources and labour in a collective</li><li>but this is not sign of egalitarian societ &gt; individual ownership of assets and deep inequities based on caste and gender distinctions</li><li>powerful elites exploited weaker section &gt; also dispense justice</li><li>Cash through trade was already established &gt; during mughals revenue was collected using cash</li><li>ARTISANS also received wages in cash &gt; also producers of cotton, silk, indigo</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>3. Women in agrarian Society</b><ol><li>Production processes &gt; men and women &gt; different roles &gt; women worked in fields</li><li>As basis of production was labour and resources of entire household &gt; it was not possible to keep women in the four wall of household only</li><li>Gender biased continue to operate &gt; mentruating women not allowed to touch potter's wheel in western india &gt; in bengal not allowed to enter groves where betel-leaves were grown</li><li>Women took to tasks &gt; spinnig yarn, sifting and kneading clay for pottery, embroidery &gt; more commercialised the product , greater the demand on women's labour</li><li>women considered important resource in agrarian society &gt; as naturally they are child bearers in a society depended on labour</li><li>but at same time &gt; high mortality rates , malnutrition, death during during births &gt; created shortage of wives &gt; this led to emergence of social customs&nbsp; unique to lower castes&nbsp;</li><li>in many cases bride-price was paid rather than dowry &gt; widow marriage was legitimate</li><li>Western india &gt; women also sent petitions to panchayats &gt; against infidelity of husbands or neglect of male head ( grihasthi )</li><li>State and superior caste groups did intervene in these matters</li><li>in most cases &gt; names of women in petitions were removed and instead they were designated as mother, sister or wife of male head</li><li>Surprisingly to the condition of women during 17th century &gt; <b>women</b> were allowed to <b>inherit the property</b> .&gt; in pubjab &gt; women actively pariticipated in rural land markets &gt; selling of property</li><li>Hindu and Muslim women inherited zamindaris &gt; free to sell or mortgage</li><li>Famous women zamindaris &gt; that of Rajshahi&nbsp;</li></ol></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>4.
